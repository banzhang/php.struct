# Predis #

Predis is a flexible and feature-complete PHP (>= 5.3) client library for the Redis key-value store.

For a list of frequently asked questions about Predis, see the __FAQ__ file in the root of the repository.
For a version compatible with PHP 5.2 you must use the backported version from the latest release in the
0.6.x series. More details are available on the [official wiki](http://wiki.github.com/nrk/predis) of the
project.


## Main features ##

- Complete support for Redis from __1.2__ to __2.6__ and unstable versions using different server profiles.
- Client-side sharding with support for consistent hashing or custom distribution strategies.
- Support for master / slave replication configurations (write on master, read from slaves).
- Command pipelining on single and aggregated connections.
- Transparent key prefixing strategy capable of handling any command known that has keys in its arguments.
- Abstraction for Redis transactions (Redis >= 2.0) with support for CAS operations (Redis >= 2.2).
- Connections to Redis instances are automatically and lazily estabilished upon the first call to a command.
- Ability to connect to Redis using TCP/IP or UNIX domain sockets with support for persistent connections.
- Ability to use alternative connection classes to use different types of network or protocol backends.
- Flexible system to define and register your own set of commands or server profiles to client instances.


## How to use Predis ##

Predis is available on [Packagist](http://packagist.org/packages/predis/predis) for an easy installation
using [Composer](http://packagist.org/about-composer). Composer helps you manage dependencies for your
projects and libraries without much hassle which makes it the preferred way to get up and running with
new applications. Alternatively, the library is available on our [own PEAR channel](http://pear.nrk.io)
for a more traditional installation via PEAR. Zip and tar.gz archives are also downloadable from GitHub
by browsing the list of [tagged releases](http://github.com/nrk/predis/tags).


### Loading the library ###

Predis relies on the autoloading features of PHP to automatically load the needed files and complies
with the [PSR-0 standard](http://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md) for
interoperability with most of the major frameworks and libraries. Everything is transparently handled
for you when installing the library using Composer, but you can also leverage its own autoloader class
if you are going to use it in a project or script without any PSR-0 compliant autoloading facility:

``` php
<?php
// prepend a base path if Predis is not present in your "include_path".
require 'Predis/Autoloader.php';

Predis\Autoloader::register();
```

You can create a single [Phar](http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.phar.php) archive from the repository
just by launching the `bin/create-phar.php` executable script. The generated Phar archive ships with a
stub defining an autoloader function for Predis, so you just need to require the Phar to be able to use
the library.

Alternatively you can generate a single PHP file that holds every class, just like older versions of
Predis, using the `bin/create-single-file.php` executable script. In this way you can load Predis in your
scripts simply by using functions such as `require` and `include`, but this practice is not encouraged.


### Connecting to a local instance of Redis ###

When connecting to local instance of Redis (`127.0.0.1` on port `6379`), you do not have to specify any
additional parameter to create a new client instance:

``` php
<?php
$redis = new Predis\Client();
$redis->set('foo', 'bar');
$value = $redis->get('foo');
```

However you can use an URI string or a named array to specify the needed connection parameters:

``` php
<?php
$redis = new Predis\Client('tcp://10.0.0.1:6379');

// is equivalent to:

$redis = new Predis\Client(array(
    'scheme' => 'tcp',
    'host'   => '10.0.0.1',
    'port'   => 6379,
));
```


### Pipelining multiple commands to multiple instances of Redis with client-side sharding ###

Pipelining helps with performances when there is the need to send many commands to a server in one go.
Furthermore, pipelining works transparently even on aggregated connections. To achieve this, Predis
supports client-side sharding using consistent-hashing on keys while clustered connections are supported
natively by the client class.

``` php
<?php
$redis = new Predis\Client(array(
    array('host' => '10.0.0.1', 'port' => 6379),
    array('host' => '10.0.0.2', 'port' => 6379)
));

$replies = $redis->pipeline(function($pipe) {
    for ($i = 0; $i < 1000; $i++) {
        $pipe->set("key:$i", str_pad($i, 4, '0', 0));
        $pipe->get("key:$i");
    }
});
```


### Overriding standard connection classes with custom ones ###

Predis allows developers to create new connection classes to add support for new protocols or override
the existing ones and provide a different implementation compared to the default classes. This can be
obtained by subclassing the `Predis\Network\IConnectionSingle` interface.

``` php
<?php
class MyConnectionClass implements Predis\Network\IConnectionSingle
{
    // implementation goes here
}

// Let Predis automatically use your own class to handle connections identified by the tcp scheme.
$client = new Predis\Client('tcp://127.0.0.1', array(
    'connections' => array('tcp' => 'MyConnectionClass')
));
```

The classes contained in the `Predis\Network` namespace give you a better insight with actual code on
how to create new connection classes.


### Defining and registering new commands on the client at runtime ###

Let's suppose Redis just added the support for a brand new feature associated with a new command. If
you want to start using the above mentioned new feature right away without messing with Predis source
code or waiting for it to find its way into a stable Predis release, then you can start off by creating
a new class that matches the command type and its behaviour and then bind it to a client instance at
runtime. Actually, it is easier done than said:

``` php
<?php
class BrandNewRedisCommand extends Predis\Commands\Command
{
    public function getId()
    {
        return 'NEWCMD';
    }
}

$redis = new Predis\Client();
$redis->getProfile()->defineCommand('newcmd', 'BrandNewRedisCommand');
$redis->newcmd();
```


## Test suite ##

__ATTENTION__: Do not ever run the test suite shipped with Predis against instances of Redis running in
production environments or containing data you are interested in!

Predis has a comprehensive test suite covering every aspect of the library. The suite performs integration
tests against a running instance of Redis (>= 2.4.0 is required) to verify the correct behaviour of the
implementation of each command and automatically skips commands not defined in the selected version of
Redis. If you do not have Redis up and running, integration tests can be disabled. By default, the test
suite is configured to execute integration tests using the server profile for Redis v2.4 (which is the
current stable version of Redis). You can optionally run the suite against a Redis instance built from
the `unstable` branch with the development profile by changing the `REDIS_SERVER_VERSION` to `dev` in
the `phpunit.xml` file. More details about testing Predis are available in `tests/README.md`.

Predis uses Travis CI for continuous integration. You can find the results of the test suite and the build
history [on its project page](http://travis-ci.org/nrk/predis).


## Contributing ##

If you want to work on Predis, it is highly recommended that you first run the test suite in order to
check that everything is OK, and report strange behaviours or bugs. When modifying Predis please make
sure that no warnings or notices are emitted by PHP by running the interpreter in your development
environment with the `error_reporting` variable set to `E_ALL | E_STRICT`.

The recommended way to contribute to Predis is to fork the project on GitHub, create new topic branches
on your newly created repository to fix or add features (possibly with tests covering your modifications)
and then open a new pull request with a description of the applied changes. Obviously you can use any
other Git hosting provider of your preference.


## Dependencies ##

- PHP >= 5.3.2
- PHPUnit >= 3.5.0 (needed to run the test suite)
